# Analyse-E-commerce-users-actions

Draft,
Aim to classify 1000 users into several types to help business team to generate a selling tactic. Methods: this project has two stages, Stage I is that we need to use RFM to evaluate the Value of the 1000 client. In Stage I we used PCA process to composite different dimensions which are actually evaluate the same dimension in RFM model. Therefore our RFM model contains more information so that we can classify the customrs more precisely

Stage II is that we ought to classify them via some methods with the result of RFM. In Stage II we used K-means to do the job. Though it may not be the best choice, we still chose it due to the time limitation.
